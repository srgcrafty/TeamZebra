	<h1>Behavior of Zebras</h1>
	<p>Zebras sleep standing up, and only when they are in a herd that can warn them of danger.</p>
	<p>If they spot a predator, they will bark or whine loudly to warn the others.</p>
	<p>They feed by grazing in large groups.</p>
	<p>Their herds are called Harems. They are very social animals.</p>
